=================

Tube station data should be downloaded first as `London-tube-stations.txt` from
[this link](http://www.doogal.co.uk/london_stations.php).  

NR station data can then be downloaded as `London-rail-stations.txt` from
[wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_London_railway_stations) with
`scrapeRailStations.py`  

This python script also converts the `tube-stations` to an identical format
